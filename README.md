# Single-Scale Fractal Feature
This repository contains the source code and images for the paper titled ["A single-scale fractal feature for classification of color images: A virus case study"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.110849),  published in Chaos, Solitons and Fractals on 19 April 2021.  

To replicate the fractal feature results from the paper, install the requirements.txt file to a new Python 3.9 virtual environment and run the `unit_tests.py` file.  The fractal calculations take ~12 minutes to complete.
